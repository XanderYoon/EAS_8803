# Week 2: Feature Engineering and Dimesionality Reduction

## Overview
In Week 2, we focus on feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance our data quality and efficiently manage large datasets.

## Contents

### Files
- **[Data_Transformation.ipynb](Data_Transformation.ipynb)**  
  Explore methods such as discretization, standardization, and various data transformations (logarithmic, reciprocal, exponential, etc.) to enhance your dataset's features.

- **[Feature_Selection.ipynb](Feature_Selection.ipynb)**  
  Learn about the different ways one can tackle the curse of dimensionality. This notebook applies different feature selecting strategies, models, and recursive programs on a high dimensional dataset predicting CO2 emissions.

- **[PCA.ipynb](PCA.ipynb)**  
  Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality of images: choropleth precipitation plots of conitiguous US, and MNIST hand writing datasets. One can be applied to a regression task(precipitation plots) and the other a classification task (dataset).
