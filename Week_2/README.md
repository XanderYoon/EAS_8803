# Week 2: Feature Engineering and Dimesionality Reduction

## Overview
In Week 2, we focus on feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques to enhance our data quality and efficiently manage large datasets.

## Contents

### Files

- **[Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb](Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb)**  
  Learn about Covariance Matrices, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Factor Analysis (LFA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (T-SNE), and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) to reduce the dimensionality of your data.

- **[Feature_Engineering.ipynb](Feature_Engineering.ipynb)**  
  Explore methods such as discretization, standardization, and various data transformations (logarithmic, reciprocal, exponential, etc.) to enhance your dataset's features. We will also apply various algorithms and models to a Drought Prediction Dataset.
