# Week 9: CNN / RNN

## Overview
In Week 8, we dive deeper into **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**. You will explore advanced neural network architectures and learn how to apply them to various real-world datasets for tasks such as image recognition and time series prediction.

## Contents

- **[CNN_Example.ipynb](CNN_Example.ipynb)**  
  Applies CNNs to the precipitation data from Maastricht, Netherlands, enhancing the predictive model compared to a simple DeepNet approach.
  
- **[CNN_intro.ipynb](CNN_intro.ipynb)**  
  Covers the basic layer types and the underlying mathematics that make CNN models effective for image and pattern recognition tasks.
  
- **[CNN+LSTM.ipynb](CNN+LSTM.ipynb)**  
  Combines CNN and LSTM architectures to predict the average monthly temperature in the contiguous United States using NOAA data.
  
- **[LSTM_Example.ipynb](LSTM_Example.ipynb)**  
  Walks through the development cycle of LSTM models using temperature data from Hartsfield-Jackson Airport.
  
- **[LSTM_Example_2.ipynb](LSTM_Example_2.ipynb)**  
  Another LSTM example utilizing the Maastricht precipitation data from Week 7 to demonstrate different applications of recurrent models.
  
- **[TransferLearning.ipynb](TransferLearning.ipynb)**  
  Explores transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models for new tasks, improving efficiency and performance.
  
- **[MNIST.ipynb](MNIST.ipynb)**  
  Walks through a classification CNN model that utilizes the popular MNIST dataset for deciphering handwritten numbers.
  
- **[Autoencoder.ipynb](Autoencoder.ipynb)**  
  Attempts a super-resolution model that takes a low-resolution choropleth temperature plot of the contiguous United States and produces a high-resolution version.
